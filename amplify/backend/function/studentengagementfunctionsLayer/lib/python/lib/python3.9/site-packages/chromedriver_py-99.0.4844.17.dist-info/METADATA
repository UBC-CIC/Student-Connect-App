from selenium import webdriver
from chromedriver_py import binary_path # this will get you the path variable

service_object = Service(binary_path)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service_object)

# deprecated but works in older selenium versions
# driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=binary_path)
driver.get("http://www.python.org")
assert "Python" in driver.title
```
