    "description": "What is the Sex Positivity Club (UBCOSPC)?\nThe UBCOSPC is a student association run by\na team of passionate students who want to open up a positive, inclusive dialogue about sex with\ntheir peers on campus. Our primary goals are to: (1) destigmatize sex, sexuality, and sexual\nhealth on campus by providing a safe, inclusive, non-judgmental space where students can\ndiscuss important topics, (2) educate students about the resources available to them on and off\ncampus, so they can make active and informed decisions about their own sexual health, and (3)\ncollaborate with other student associations, campus initiatives, and local organizations to\npromote safer sex practices within our campus community.\n\nHow does the UBCOSPC operate?\nThe UBCOSPC acts as a club and meets periodically\nthroughout the year via discussion groups and workshops. One of our most successful events we\nran this past year was a workshop called BDSM 101, which was designed to debunk common\nmyths about BDSM and educate students on how to practice kink safely and responsibly, with a\nheavy emphasis on consent and communication.\n\nWhat benefits will I get for joining the UBCOSPC?\nThe biggest benefit is you get to speak with likeminded students and build community with those who also care about sexual health! Throughout the year we run multiple giveaways, some including sex toys and some including experiences with local organizations. When you come to our meetings, you get extra entries into these giveaways, which you are definitely going to want! When we are back in-person, we will also have free condoms, lube, resources, and refreshments available for students at each and every one of our meetings and events.\nInstagram: @ubcospc\nhttps://youtu.be/1DLS_MqTw6I\n",
