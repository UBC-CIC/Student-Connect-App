# Deployment Guide

To deploy this solution, deploy the ***backend*** first, and then the ***frontend***

## Backend Deployment
<hr/>

## Deployment Steps
The application can be deployed from either MacOS, Linux, Windows or Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Some system installation requirements before starting deployment:
* A copy of the repository downloaded onto the local machine from which you are running the deployment
* AWS SAM installed and setup for use on your system, details on the installation can be found
  [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).
  (NOTE: The third step of installing Docker is only needed for testing the lambda functions in this app locally, it
  does not have to be installed for the sole purpose of deployment)
* Python3.8 or above installed and added to PATH (you can select this in the installer), download the
  installer [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/).
  NOTE: Run ```pip install wheel``` in the command line ***if*** there are any issues with ```sam build``` resolving dependencies in Step 1
  

1) Open the terminal at the root folder of the repository, and then run the deployment script using the following command using
   your own parameter values inside the angle brackets. The order of arguments must be the same as shown.

   For Mac, Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux users:

   ```   
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh --aws-profile <AWS_PROFILE> --aws-region <AWS_REGION> --stack-name <STACK_NAME>
   ```

   For Windows users:
   ```   
   deploy.bat aws-profile:<AWS_PROFILE> aws-region:<AWS_REGION> stack-name:<STACK_NAME>
   ```
    Where,
    * AWS_PROFILE: Name of the profile setup in your AWS config for the SAM CLI to use for deployment
    * AWS_REGION: AWS Region to deploy the application in
    * STACK_NAME: Name given to your application, only allows lower case a-z letters with the addition of numbers and hyphens.

   This script will:
   <ul>
   <li>make a copy of a python file into some lambda sub-folders for deployment</li>
   <li>use AWS SAM and Python to build the lambda functions and its dependencies</li>
   <li>package them into a deployment zip in a default, SAM-created S3 bucket</li>
   <li>and finally deploy them using the cloudformation template, template.yaml </li>
   </ul>
    
    <br/>

    (Depending on your computer settings, some users might have PythonPipBuilder pointing to `python` instead of `python3`. If you run into this error, under ***line 22*** in the `deploy.sh` file , change `sam build` to `sam build --use-container`.)

    After running the script, at one point it will run a guided SAM deployment:
   
    Pick the default options for each prompt, except for:
    
    ```
    Confirm changes before deploy [y/N]:
    ```   
    and
    ```
    Deploy this changeset? [y/N]:
    ```
    which will need either `y` or `Y` to confirm the deployment.
   Here are what all the deployment prompts look like for a proper deployment:
   ![Deployment Prompts](./DeploymentPrompts_1.png)
   ![Deployment Prompts](./DeploymentPrompts_2.png)
   
   This deployment step takes some time (about 20 minutes) due to creating the Elasticsearch domain, which itself takes
   about 15 minutes.
   
2) Once the deployment is complete, go on the AWS Management Console and select the Lambda service. Under the filter textbox, type in the stack name that you have given in step 1 and press enter to get lambda functions that are related to this stack. 

    * The 5 functions that you need here are `getBlogData`, `getNewsData`, `getEventsData`, `getAthleticsNewsData`, and `getClubData`. Click into any one of them except `getClubData`. For `getClubData`, see step 3. ![lambda functions image](./LambdaFunctions.PNG)

    * Under the **Test** tab, create a new test event and click on the **Test** button. ![lambda functions image](./LambdaFunctions_2.PNG) Wait for the test event to finish successfully run. Repeat this step for the other 3 functions.

    * You only need to manually trigger the functions to get the data on your first deployment. Later, the lambda functions are scheduled to run every once a day to fetch new data. 

3) ** This is a temporary step for this phase of the development. The club and course union website did not have categories for the clubs, so they were categorised via a non-programmatic manual process. Hence, they are manually added into the Elasticsearch index as this is not a part of the automatic data gathering process. To add the clubs data, the steps are:
   * Login to the AWS Console and visit the S3 console. Find the bucket named 
     `engagement-app-datastore-<AWS_REGION>-<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>` and click on it
   * Drag and drop the `AllUBCOClubs.json` file in the `docs` folder of this repository to the S3 bucket, then click
    **Upload** at the bottom and leave all other options at default.
   * Now navigate back to the Lambda Service Console, create and run a test for the `getClubData` function.
   Once the execution is complete and successful, the clubs data should be present in Elasticsearch.
   Ideally this step should not be manual and should be automated, the details of achieving this are mentioned
   in the [further backend refinement section](https://github.com/UBC-CIC/UBCO-StudentEngagementApp/blob/main/docs/DataAggregationArchitecture.md#further-backend-refinement)

4) Next, follow the next steps to have Kibana set up (a visualisation plugin for Elasticsearch)
    * Login to the AWS Console on a browser and visit the Cloudformation console. Find the application you deployed and 
      click on the **Outputs** tab.
      ![outputs tab image](./OutputsTab.PNG)
        
    * Find the values for the KibanaUrl, KibanaUser and KibanaPassword. 
      Visit the KibanaUrl and login with the default Kibana Username (always set as `kibana`), and the pre-generated
      8 letter Kibana password. After logging in, it will prompt you to change the password.
      Keep this password noted, as it is not linked to any email for resetting, it exists as part of a Cognito User.
      
5) You can now verify that the deployment has worked properly by checking if the data has been persisted to Elasticsearch.
   * Click on the hamburger menu icon on the top left, and then scroll down to **Stack Management** and click on it.
   ![Kibana Stacks](./ElasticsearchStacks.PNG)
   * Then click on **Index Patterns** on the left Menu and then **Create Index Pattern** 
   ![Elasticsearch Index Patterns](./IndexPatterns.PNG)
   * Type in a valid index pattern (as of now, the valid options are `events`, `news`, `blogs`, `athleticsnews`, `clubs`**
   as these are the data sources we have), then click **Next Step** and proceed with the defaults to have the index setup. If you only see `blogs` and `news`, please wait for another 10-20 minutes. As of this step, you should see `events`, `news`, `blogs`, `athleticsnews`, and `clubs`.
   * Use the hamburger menu on the left and navigate to the **Discover** tab, then pick an index to visualise its data.
    
    If the deployment has proceeded perfectly, some data should be shown here:

## Frontend Deployment
<hr/>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) .

## Installation

Follow these instructions to deploy the frontend:

1 - Before installing Amplify we need to create the IAM Role that associates the policies needed to implement this solution. From the cloned directory, execute the following CloudFormation template: 

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file cfn-amplifyRole.yaml --stack-name studentengagement-amplify-role --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

It creates the role name **amplifyconsole-studentengagement-backend-role** that will be used on the next step.

2 - Use the provided **1-click deployment** button below.

[![One-click deployment](https://oneclick.amplifyapp.com/button.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home#/deploy?repo=https://github.com/UBC-CIC/UBCO-StudentEngagementApp/tree/test_ddb)

3 - Select **Connect to GitHub**, and then you will be asked to connect to your GitHub account. Amplify Console will fork this repository into your GitHub account before deploying.

4 - Select your AWS service role that we have just created (**amplifyconsole-studentengagement-backend-role**) in the dropdown.

5 - Expand the *Environment variables* section and enter the following:

    Key: USER_BRANCH
    Value: dev

![Environment variable](./AmplifyDeploymentEnvVariable.png)

The **USER_BRANCH** variable defines the environment container that we will be using for the Amplify project. It has the same value that we have given to the parameter **EnvironmentName** during our SAM deployment in the back-end. 

If you would like to use a different environment container, please make sure that both frontend's USER_BRANCH and backend's EnvironmentName have the same value.

6 - Click Save and Deploy, and wait for deployment to complete in the Amplify console. This may take some time to complete.

## Logging in

Cognito is used for user authentication. Users will need to input their email address and a password to create an account.
After account creation, users will need to verify their account by inputting the 6-digit verification code that was sent to their provided email address before being able to log in to the system.

AML (shibboleth) integration using Cognito has been added with instrictions to deploy [here](./AuthenticationArchitecture.md). The instructions in the following link should be followed after completing the deployment to enable the Shibboleth integration using One-login.

## Next Steps

When the user logged into the app for the first time, the app will direct the user to answer a survey. The survey results will be stored in
  a DynamoDB table to provide recommendation results in the user's 'for you' page. The survey results can  be edited in the app, if the user's
  preference changed, the user can modify their preferences there and gets personalized content.

## Production stage & PWA
When the app gets into production stage, please uncomment the code at `line 31-45` in the file 
`public/index.html`, and uncomment all the code in `public/service-worker.js`. Uncommenting these code will make the app become a 
Progressive Web Application (PWA).
